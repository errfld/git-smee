# Legacy Beads Snapshot

This directory stores an archived snapshot of Beads data used during migration to GitHub Issues.

- `issues.jsonl`: exported Beads issues used as migration input.
- `metadata.json`: original Beads metadata captured at archive time.

New task tracking is GitHub-native. Do not add or modify Beads data for active work.
